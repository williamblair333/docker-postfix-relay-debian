# lxc-debian-mail-relay
Debian 10 Buster  
  
A simple bash script with reference files to setup an lxc mail relay container.  Free time and how much punishment I want to inflict on myself - I will post a guide on the lxc server host soon..

Update 2023SEP18:  I really don't recommend anyone use lxc anymore.  Either use a virtual machine or use Docker / Podman. Trust me, you'll be saving yourself a lot of headache.  I can't speak to lxd, but Canonical owns it, so it's probably robust and mature enough.
